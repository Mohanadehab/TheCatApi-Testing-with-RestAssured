## Project Overview

This project focuses on API testing for TheCatAPI, a public API that provides data related to cats (such as breeds, images, votes, etc.). The project utilizes Postman to document the API endpoints and automate tests. The goal is to ensure that the API behaves as expected, including handling edge cases and invalid inputs.

## Features

- **Automated API Testing**: Various tests are automated to validate the behavior of the API.
- **Postman Collection**: Well-structured Postman documentation and collection for testing.
- **Basic API Requests**: GET, POST, and DELETE requests are demonstrated.
- **Error Handling**: Tests for invalid inputs and error scenarios.
- **Assertion Checks**: Ensure correct responses and behavior based on API specifications.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/APIProject.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash

   ```

3. Install the required dependencies for testing:
   - Install Postman if you havenâ€™t already: [Download Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)
   - Open the Postman collection provided within the project.

## Usage

To test the API:

1. Open Postman and import the provided Postman collection:
   - Go to **File > Import**, then select the Postman collection (`API_Testing_Collection.postman_collection.json`) from the project directory.

2. Run the collection in Postman:
   - Click on the **Runner** tab in Postman.
   - Select the collection and start the test runner to execute the tests.

3. Review the test results:
   - After the tests are completed, view the test results for each endpoint, including passed and failed tests, along with detailed error information if applicable.

## Project Structure
